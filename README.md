Every Hotel and Restaurant needs an orderly and systematic way to keep their data given the 
incoming Customer and order details. The maintenance of All the entities in the databases must be 
handled by each Hotel and Restaurantâ€™s administration. These databases' records provide basic 
information including room details, order details, employee details, payment details, etc.
Our solution involves the development of an integrated system with multiple modules, including 
Customer, Employee, Delivery System, and Hotel/Restaurant Details. This system will automate 
and consolidate information, allowing data to be easily passed from one entity to another. Here's 
an example of how this system would work:
Customer will interact with the system for various purposes, such as making reservations, placing 
orders, or tracking their requests. They will have unique identifiers, such as a Cust ID, to access 
their information within the system.
Employees in hotels and restaurants will have access to the system to manage guest requests, 
orders, and reservations. When a guest inquires about the status of their order or reservation, the 
staff can easily retrieve this information by entering the customer's ID.
Our primary objective is data-driven approach, we aspire to offer actionable information that can 
guide the restaurant in marking strategies, and overall operations. Ultimately, our analysis will 
empower the restaurant to make informed decisions and enhance its competitiveness in an everevolving industry
